## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid





### What I learned

That its actually easy messing with the opcaity of colors by changing the hsl alpha value

 ```
background: linear-gradient(to right, hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.1), hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.1));
```




### Continued development

i might come back to this challenge to add some functionality i have some ideas in mind
